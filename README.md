This was a project taken as a way of learning some of the basics of Python and Pygame. At the beginning of the project I didn't know any Python at all and it shows. However, everything came together in the end and the game is complete.

Feel free to take it and break it.

###Features:

- Ability to mark mines by right clicking suspicious grids
- Double click revealed squares which have had all the nearby mines marked to reveal all the safe squares
- First click is always a blank space and therefore safe.
